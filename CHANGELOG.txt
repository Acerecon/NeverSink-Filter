----------------------------------
NeverSink's itemfilter - version 4.1 (for POE 2.4/atlas ECONOMY UPDATE)
----------------------------------

**Filterversions** :

- **Regular** - displays all rares
- **Semi-Strict** - hides all "*/bad rares" in the endgame and also all "clunky/ok" rares. Also hides clunky chromatic recipes, still shows gavels and a very small asortment of crafting trinkets (twostone, onyx, diamond)
- **Strict** - hides all non-good and even the good/2h items that are not top-tier. Recommended for large parties and heavy magic find characters. NOT recommended for beginners.
- **Slick** - same as regular, however less colors.

You can get more information and the filter itself:

Or you can get the filter directely from my GITHUB

If you want the notepad++ highlighting you can also find it on GITHUB

**NOTE:** Currently there exists a bug, that causes some fonts to appear weird ("empty boxes", distance between letters distant or wrong letters). This bug is caused by the POE engine itself and is not related to the filter (it can happen with other filters or even without them in other game parts too). If this happens to you: restart the game and it should be all gone. Please stop E-Mailing me about it, there's sadly nothing I can do, since this is client-related. GGG is aware of the bug.

CHANGELOG:
----------------------------------

**CONTENT:**

- Reworked the divination card tier list. The new tier list is more suited to represent the current economy.
- Updated the unique item tier list to better fit the current economy.
- Added ilvl >= 50 crude bows, since those are meta now.
- The semi-strict version now displays all chisel recipes
- The semi-strict version now has a small assortment of pre 83/84 crafting trinkets (twostone, onyx, diamond - only 75+)

**VISUAL:**

- Slightly tweaked the divination card appearances. Higher divination cards now stand out a little more.
- Changed the rare jewel appearance to have a tiny bit more contrast

**SOUNDS:**

- Stacked decks, shrieking essences and master cartographers sextants , now give off a mid tier (2) sound, instead of an high tier (6) drop sound.
- Random map fragments now make a mid tier (2) sound instead of a map drop sound (4). This way boss kills in corrupted maps, don't give the illusion of dropping maps.

**BUGFIXES:**

- The Semi-strict version, now correctly hides clunky rares.
- The Semi-strict version, now correctly displays mediocre rares (ilvl 75+) in the orangish hue
- The Slick version now uses the correct borders for top tier rares.
