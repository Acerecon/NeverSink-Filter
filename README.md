**INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:**

--------------------------

1) Download the latest filter from the "releases" section. 

2) Extract the files using WinRar/7zip or a similar tool.

3) Paste the .filter files (or just the folder content) into the following folder: *%userprofile%/Documents/My Games/Path of Exile*

4) INGAME: Escape -> Options -> UI -> Scroll down -> Select one of the filters from the dropdown box.

5) Done. Enjoy.

I recommend using NotePad++ to edit the filter.

**FILTER VERSIONS:**

--------------------------

- **Regular** = The normal version. Nice balance of hidden/shown items in the endgame.
- **Semi-Strict** = Hides several bulky and bad-based rares in the endgame and is designed for experienced players.
- **Strict** - Hides the majority of all rares in the endgame. It only shows the very best rares.
- **Slick** = Less Background Colors (more GGG-styled).
